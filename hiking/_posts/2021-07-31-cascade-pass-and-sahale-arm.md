This was the final hike of my summer at Amazon and I got to share it with 2 other interns, Alex and Jeremy. The trail is nestled away in North Cascades National Park, which is fairly out of the way but worth it nonetheless.<!--more--> Blooming wildflowers and grassy meadows give way to expansive views of the stunning Cascade Range and at the end, there's a glacier that we tried climbing up and sliding down; I guess we didn't get enough of the glissading at Camp Muir. Overall, the hike took us a good 5-6 hours and it was a very satisfying end to my 3 months in Washington.
