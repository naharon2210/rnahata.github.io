I got to spend a week with my parents in Mount Rainier before the onslaught of school and so I had a chance to revisit one of my favourite hikes in the area.<!--more--> Originally, we were planning to just hike the [Skyline Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/skyline-trail) but my parents, understanding of my aggressive hiking pace, were fine with me just wandering off. As such, I decided to take a detour up the mountain! This time, I was very ill-equipped, with no spikes, no poles, and a single protein bar to eat and on top of that, I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. However, the one thing I had this time that I didn't have the last time were a pair of sunglasses, which turned out to be a game-changer, as my eyes were spared from sunburn. The actual ascent was actually pretty straightforward, even though I was missing equipment, and I just had to be more prudent about where I was putting my feet. At the top, a kind gentleman was nice enough to lend me a spare trash bag, allowing me to glissade down the mountain once more; this time, however, my legs and arms were exposed and they ended up getting a little cut up, but it was worth it for the thrill. After all, cuts heal.

I didn't take too many pictures this time but do enjoy this very photogenic marmot.
