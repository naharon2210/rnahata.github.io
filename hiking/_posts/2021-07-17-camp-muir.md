Camp Muir is the highest point you can reach on Mount Rainier without a permit and it was also my first hike with fellow Amazon interns. We were a group of 5 and it took us about 3 hours to reach Camp Muir from the trailhead.<!--more--> The second half of the ascent is up snow and regarding this, I have a lot of comments. First, I made the mistake of not bringing actual sunglasses and I ended up getting sunburnt in my eye, which was a peculiar and painful experience. Also, hiking in snow is so demoralizing because things seem much closer than they actually are and you feel like you're making no progress; the end of the hike is such a tease because you see the camp way before you actually get there. Finally, bring a trash bag to glissade down the mountain! There are a lot of pre-dug chutes and sliding down the mountain is incredibly exhilarating. Being a bit of an adrenaline junkie, I was looking to optimize my top speed and I actually got pretty good at it. Here's some tips and tricks I picked up.

*   Don't just plop yourself down; get a running start so it's easier to break the friction.
*   Lift your legs so only your butt is touching the snow. Minimizing your friction comes down to minimizing your contact with the snow.
*   Drag your arms in the snow to steer. You don't need an ice axe; drag your right elbow in the snow to veer right and likewise for veering left.
*   Don't be scared of going fast! There honestly aren't that many ways to get hurt doing this. Worst come to worst, you just spin out.

For some reason, my phone took pictures on night mode so the colors are a bit weird.
