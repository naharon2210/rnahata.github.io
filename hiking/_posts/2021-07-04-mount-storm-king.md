Located in Olympic National Park, this is a short but really steep ascent that culminates in a majestic view of Lake Crescent. The whole trail is really exposed so sunscreen is a must.<!--more--> I think my group took about 1 and a half to 2 hours to reach the top. Near the end, the trail gets so steep to the point that you have to pull yourself up using sets of ropes; there's usually a stack of gloves left by generous hikers at the start so your hands don't get destroyed.
