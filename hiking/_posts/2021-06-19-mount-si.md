The Mount Si trail is just an hour out from Seattle, and can be accessed via the Mount Si Direct ORCA line. A reasonably challenging trail with tons of switchbacks, it took me about 2 hours to get up.<!--more--> For most of the trail, you're walking in shaded woods but the top is very exposed. Don't be like me and bring sunscreen, otherwise you'll get burnt to a crisp. At the top, you also have the option to scramble up to the summit, which I thought was a fun and exciting way to end the climb.
