HKN retreat took us to Sequoia National Park this semester, allowing me to fit another hike into my otherwise busy schedule. Gilbert, Michael, Vikas, Will, and I set out around 2 PM on the roughly 9-mile hike.<!--more--> I had been to Sequoia National Park before when I was really young and I had mainly seen the trees at the time and so I didn't know that Sequoia was very well-known for its grandiose granite formations as well. After an initial relaxed ascent through a wooded landscape, we emerged on a rocky outcrop and were presented with a breathtaking view of the sharp, jutting granite. The remainder of the hike was spent along a high ridge, giving us a fantastic view of the valley. Overall, I thought this was one of the views on this hike were some of the most sublime I've seen. Oh, and at the end, we saw a bear!
