No, this was not a free solo but it was still amazing in its own right. Jason and I had been planning a trip to Yosemite for over a month and originally, we were planning on doing Cloud's Rest<!--more--> but road conditions forced us to go to a plan B and that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The initial ascent up to the Upper Falls from Yosemite Valley was tough but we were able to knock it out in about an hour. After that, we walked through a tranquil, wooded landscape, crossing rivers and snow, until we reached the fantastic jutting outcrop of El Capitan. All in all, we did about 16 miles in 8 and a half hours and at the end, we were so famished that we made a food stop to decide between Chick Fil-A and Cane's and ended up just getting both.
