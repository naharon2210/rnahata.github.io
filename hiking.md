# Hiking Journal

I'll try my best to document all the hikes that I go on.

## [Watchtower Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/watchtower-trail) - 2022/08/27

HKN retreat took us to Sequoia National Park this semester, allowing me to fit another hike into my otherwise busy schedule. Gilbert, Michael, Vikas, Will, and I set out around 2 PM on the roughly 9-mile hike. I had been to Sequoia National Park before when I was really young and I had mainly seen the trees at the time and so I didn't know that Sequoia was very well-known for its grandiose granite formations as well. After an initial relaxed ascent through a wooded landscape, we emerged on a rocky outcrop and were presented with a breathtaking view of the sharp, jutting granite. The remainder of the hike was spent along a high ridge, giving us a fantastic view of the valley. Overall, I thought this was one of the views on this hike were some of the most sublime I've seen. Oh, and at the end, we saw a bear!

## [Camp Muir](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/camp-muir-route-via-skyline-trail) (Second Time) - 2022/08/18

I got to spend a week with my parents in Mount Rainier before the onslaught of school and so I had a chance to revisit one of my favourite hikes in the area. Originally, we were planning to just hike the [Skyline Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/skyline-trail) but my parents, understanding of my aggressive hiking pace, were fine with me just wandering off. As such, I decided to take a detour up the mountain! This time, I was very ill-equipped, with no spikes, no poles, and a single protein bar to eat and on top of that, I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. However, the one thing I had this time that I didn't have the last time were a pair of sunglasses, which turned out to be a game-changer, as my eyes were spared from sunburn. The actual ascent was actually pretty straightforward, even though I was missing equipment, and I just had to be more prudent about where I was putting my feet. At the top, a kind gentleman was nice enough to lend me a spare trash bag, allowing me to glissade down the mountain once more; this time, however, my legs and arms were exposed and they ended up getting a little cut up, but it was worth it for the thrill. After all, cuts heal.

I didn't take too many pictures this time but do enjoy this very photogenic marmot.

## [El Capitan](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/el-capitan-from-yosemite-valley) - 2022/04/03

No, this was not a free solo but it was still amazing in its own right. Jason and I had been planning a trip to Yosemite for over a month and originally, we were planning on doing Cloud's Rest but road conditions forced us to go to a plan B and that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The initial ascent up to the Upper Falls from Yosemite Valley was tough but we were able to knock it out in about an hour. After that, we walked through a tranquil, wooded landscape, crossing rivers and snow, until we reached the fantastic jutting outcrop of El Capitan. All in all, we did about 16 miles in 8 and a half hours and at the end, we were so famished that we made a food stop to decide between Chick Fil-A and Cane's and ended up just getting both.

## [Creamery Meadow, Bluffs, Panorama, and Ridge Trail Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/creamery-meadow-bluffs-panorama-and-ridge-trail-loop) - 2022/03/06

My friends Albert, Sahil, Tianchen and I decided to head out to the Big Sur for a day and this is the trail we went with. We were not disappointed. This 8 mile trail takes you right to the edge of the Big Sur, allowing you to walk right alongside the ocean. At the beginning, we had to wade across a stream that was about knee-height at its deepest point and after that, it was a short ascent before we were confronted with the view of the sea. Hiking right beside the infinite expanse of the Pacific is nothing short of sublime. As we walked along, we were accompanied by an extraordinary view that felt just like Friedrich's *Wanderer above the Sea of Fog*. Besides the initial ascent, the hike is very gentle and towards the end, there is even an opportunity to frolick on the beach.

## [Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/cascade-pass-and-sahale-arm-trail--2) - 2021/07/31

This was the final hike of my summer at Amazon and I got to share it with 2 other interns, Alex and Jeremy. The trail is nestled away in North Cascades National Park, which is fairly out of the way but worth it nonetheless. Blooming wildflowers and grassy meadows give way to expansive views of the stunning Cascade Range and at the end, there's a glacier that we tried climbing up and sliding down; I guess we didn't get enough of the glissading at Camp Muir. Overall, the hike took us a good 5-6 hours and it was a very satisfying end to my 3 months in Washington.

## [The Enchantments](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/the-enchantments-trail) - 2021/07/24

The highlight of my summer in Seattleâ€”the Enchantments is a glorious, awe-inspiring, 20-mile trek that pushes you to your limits but rewards you handsomely for it. I planned this hike for weeks leading up to it and rounded up a group of about 10-15 Amazon interns. We stayed in a hotel in Wenachtee the night before and got up at 3 AM to start the day. I hiked from 6:15 AM to 8:45 PM and by the end I was completely spent but it was one of the best experiences of my life.

Initially, the hike takes you through a thickly wooded area until you reach the magnificent Colchuck Lake, which is strikingly blue. Take a second to admire the beauty of the lake and the reflections of Dragontail Peak because Colchuck Lake is the calm before the storm. The next leg of the hike is up Aasgard Pass, an incredibly steep and exhausting ascent. Aasgard Pass acts as sort of the gate to the Enchantments, though, and once you make it to the top, you arrive at the Upper Enchantments. A series of lakes, the Enchantments genuinely feels like an alternate, fairy-tale world. Mountain goats roam around as you admire the sublime landscape and descend down to the Lower Enchantments. At this point, you're about halfway done and in my opinion, the remainder of the hike isn't nearly as exciting. You descend down to Snow Lake and eventually make your way back to Icicle Road.

Lastly, the bugs on this trail are something else. I put on 99% concentrated DEET but I still got assailed and bit all over. It was worth it though; the hike was a truly wondrous experience.

## [Camp Muir](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/camp-muir-route-via-skyline-trail) - 2021/07/17

Camp Muir is the highest point you can reach on Mount Rainier without a permit and it was also my first hike with fellow Amazon interns. We were a group of 5 and it took us about 3 hours to reach Camp Muir from the trailhead. The second half of the ascent is up snow and regarding this, I have a lot of comments. First, I made the mistake of not bringing actual sunglasses and I ended up getting sunburnt in my eye, which was a peculiar and painful experience. Also, hiking in snow is so demoralizing because things seem much closer than they actually are and you feel like you're making no progress; the end of the hike is such a tease because you see the camp way before you actually get there. Finally, bring a trash bag to glissade down the mountain! There are a lot of pre-dug chutes and sliding down the mountain is incredibly exhilarating. Being a bit of an adrenaline junkie, I was looking to optimize my top speed and I actually got pretty good at it. Here's some tips and tricks I picked up.

*   Don't just plop yourself down; get a running start so it's easier to break the friction.
*   Lift your legs so only your butt is touching the snow. Minimizing your friction comes down to minimizing your contact with the snow.
*   Drag your arms in the snow to steer. You don't need an ice axe; drag your right elbow in the snow to veer right and likewise for veering left.
*   Don't be scared of going fast! There honestly aren't that many ways to get hurt doing this. Worst come to worst, you just spin out.

For some reason, my phone took pictures on night mode so most of the colors are a bit weird in my photos.

## [Mount Teneriffe](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/mount-teneriffe-via-mount-teneriffe-trailhead) - 2021/07/10

Like Mount Si, Mount Teneriffe is also easily accessible from Seattle, with a dedicated ORCA line to the trailhead. You have two different options for making the ascent: a more roundabout trail and the Kamikaze Trail. I opted for the Kamikaze trail, which shortens the length of the climb at the expense of your legs; the Kamikaze trail was extremely steep and I found myself taking very frequent breaks especially as I neared the end. When I hiked this trail, it was pretty cloudy so the summit was quite underwhelming. On my way down, I decided to spare my knees and take the more roundabout route.

I ascended the Kamikaze Trail alongside another hiker, which was nice because it gave me reassurance that I was not veering off-trail at any point. As the climb went on, I think we developed a mutual respect for each other, which was pretty cool, and we ended up taking the descent together. His name was Aaron, I think, and we talked about what we were up to. He recently graduated from the University of Arizona and was working in Seattle; he said he enjoyed hikes in the city a lot and he didn't actually come out to the woods too often; he also talked about his high school days, when fast food restaurants like Domino's used to sponsor his lunches, and his journey to living a more healthy life. We both took the bus back and at my stop, we parted ways. Hiking is cool because often, you get to meet people like Aaron that you might never have met otherwise.

## [Mount Storm King](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/mount-storm-king) - 2021/07/04

Located in Olympic National Park, this is a short but really steep ascent that culminates in a majestic view of Lake Crescent. The whole trail is really exposed so sunscreen is a must. I think my group took about 1 and a half to 2 hours to reach the top. Near the end, the trail gets so steep to the point that you have to pull yourself up using sets of ropes; there's usually a stack of gloves left by generous hikers at the start so your hands don't get destroyed.

## [Mount Si](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/mount-si-trail) - 2021/06/19

The Mount Si trail is just an hour out from Seattle, and can be accessed via the Mount Si Direct ORCA line. A reasonably challenging trail with tons of switchbacks, it took me about 2 hours to get up. For most of the trail, you're walking in shaded woods but the top is very exposed. Don't be like me and bring sunscreen, otherwise you'll get burnt to a crisp. At the top, you also have the option to scramble up to the summit, which I thought was a fun and exciting way to end the climb.
