# About

Hi! I'm Richard, a senior studying EECS at UC Berkeley. I also teach [CS 70](https://www.eecs70.org/) and lead a research group exploring federated learning, advised by [James Demmel](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/). Sometime in fall 2023, I will be joining [Radix Trading](https://www.radix-trading.com/) full-time as a Quantitative Technologist.

In my free time, I enjoy:
*   **Hiking** - My favourite trail is **[The Enchantments]({% link hiking/_posts/2021-07-24-enchantments.md %}) in Washington** and most recently, I hiked the **[Watchtower Trail]({% link hiking/_posts/2022-08-27-watchtower.md %}) in Sequoia National Park**.
*   **Reading** - *Anna Karenina* is the greatest novel of all time and Jane Austen is the funniest human that has ever lived or will ever live.
*   **Cooking** - I love making pasta and dumplings and I am ideologically opposed to store-bought dumpling wrappers.
*   **Lifting** - On a good day, I'm **70%** of the way through the road to 20 pull-ups and on a bad day, it drops to **60%** ðŸ™ƒ I also got pinned at the RSF one time but I still don't use the safety catches when I bench by myself.
*   **Music** - Favourite artists have got to be Nas, Kanye, ELO, Daft Punk, 2Pac, Beethoven, Elton John, and Dire Straits. Recently, I've been listening to **Wu-Tang**, **reggaeton**, and **French indie pop**.
*   **NYT Crosswords** - Proud to say that on 10 August 2022 at 22:39 PDT, I completed the Wednesday in 51:11 with no checks or bashing for the final missing letter. Someday, I'll get a Thursday by myself. Not anytime soon though ðŸ˜“

I support Liverpool Football Club! âœŠ YNWA ðŸ”´
